 SMALL GROUPS   
Small Groups are an opportunity for each of us to dive deeper into community, friendship, and our spiritual growth. Whether you're a face-to-face person or a digital dynamo, we've got you covered. There's a spot just for you here. And guess what? We're currently exploring the KNOW GOD study, a journey that's all about getting closer to the heart of who God is. So, let's get connected, let's grow, and let's do this together. Ready to find your group? Dive into the form below and let's make some magic happen! Make plans now to also attend the Small Group Summit at the end of this small group semester.
