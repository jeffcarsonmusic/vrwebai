What to 
Expect 
on Sunday
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?
Most people wear jeans at our church, including the pastors. We encourage you to dress as you feel most comfortable.
DO YOU SERVE COFFEE?
Yep. We just got espresso and breakfast taco's now, and we have some pretty decent drip coffee too. Come a few minutes early and grab yourself a free cup before you head into the auditorium.
WHAT ABOUT MY KIDS?
They're going to LOVE our Dreamer's Kids Ministry! We have a safe and creative environment created so your children will have an amazing time of worship, an age-distinctive message, with fun and games.
DO YOU HAVE SMALL GROUPS?
Yes! We have small groups year-round where people get together around an activity or topic with the intention of encouraging each other and helping one another grow in our faith. You can sign up at church in the connect center on Sunday or click 
SMALL GROUPS.
HOW DO I MEET PEOPLE?
Trying to figure out if this is your church home? We get it. Our Next Steps class was created to help you get the answers you are looking for about who we are, what we believe, and how to get connected. Childcare is provided. The first class is every Sunday 10 minutes after our service.
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU PLAY?
Our worship songs are current, upbeat, and celebratory in nature. We like to sing praise and worship to glorify God. Some of the music is written by members of the Dreamer's Church band.
HOW LONG IS THE SERVICE?
Our service is about an hour and thirty minutes long. We have the cafe open from 10:45 to 11:15 AM. We encourage you to come early and fellowship before either service starts at 9:30 or 11:15 AM.
CAN I LEARN MORE ABOUT THE CHURCH?
Every Sunday after each service we host a class called 
Next Steps
. It's about 40 minutes long and we share the vision and values of the church. This is a great way to meet our pastors personally in a small environment, hear their hearts for Austin and ask any questions you want. We provide snacks and childcare for the class.
