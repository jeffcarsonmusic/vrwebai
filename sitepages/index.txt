Christian Church in Austin
In our current sermon series 
"Words Shape Our World," 
we're diving into the incredible power of our words. It's all about recognizing that what we say really matters, just like we see all throughout the Bible. From the get-go in Genesis 1, God speaks the universe to life—showing us just how powerful His words are. Proverbs 18:21 hits home by telling us, "the tongue has the power of life and death." showing us how powerful our words are. Jesus reinforces this in Mark 11:23 teaching us that if we speak in faith, we can move mountains.
