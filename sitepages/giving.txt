LEGACY OFFERING
As we launched Dreamer’s Church five years ago, God spoke to us about five areas to believe for a legacy, harvest, and heritage. He told us to not wait, but to plant faith seeds from day one and believe for a harvest. The Legacy Offering is our free-will offering, given above the tithe to help fulfill the vision of Dreamer’s Church. Here are our five 
Legacy Offering focuses:
1.    
GATHERINGS
: Build a healthy church that gathers on Sundays and regularly in small groups
2.    
OUTREACH
: Citywide outreach, believing for revival here in Austin and beyond
3.    
S.O.L.D.
: School of Leadership Development/Bible College/School of Worship/Music
4.    
CHURCH PLANTING
: Raise up and send out church planters and support missions work
5.    
OWN A BUILDING
: Facility to house our church services, school, and outreach activities
