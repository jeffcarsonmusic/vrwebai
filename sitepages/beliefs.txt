WHAT WE BELIEVE
"We are called to seek first the kingdom of God"
Core Beliefs
THE BIBLE
 – GOD’S BOOK
The Scriptures have been written by men under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is relevant to all people, everywhere. Being inspired by God, the Bible is without error and pertinent to everyday life as a believer.  
(1 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:16)
THE CHURCH
 – GOD’S COMMUNITY
The church is God’s plan for believers to learn and grow in relationship with Him. Unified through faith and the desire to glorify God, the church is God’s community of people who are committed to becoming more like Him.  
(Acts 2; I Corinthians 11; Hebrews 10:25)
THE TRINITY
 – GOD; THREE IN ONE
God has revealed Himself as one God existing in the three person: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Each of these roles is unique from the others but, at the same time, they cannot be separated from each other.  
(Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14)
THE FATHER
 – GOD IS GOOD
God reveals Himself throughout Scripture as a faithful, loving father. Despite man’s continual disobedience and rebellion towards God, He continually acts graciously towards us. His story unfolding throughout eternity is that of unconditional love.
 (Luke 15:20-24, James 1:16-18, John 14:1-6,
Ephesians 2:17-19, Matthew 6:6-13)
JESUS CHRIST
 – GOD BECAME MAN
Jesus was born of a virgin, Mary, and lived on earth as fully man and fully God. By living a perfect life, He has met the requirements of God for righteousness. Through the sacrifice of His life upon a roman cross, He has enabled forgiveness of sins. He rose from the dead after 3 days and, in doing so, offers us the ability to follow Him in living victorious over sin and death.  
(Acts 1:20; Romans 4:25; I Corinthians 15:1-8, Matthew 24; Mark 16:19; John 14:2-3; Acts 1:9-11; Philippians 2:5-11; I Thessalonians 4:13-18; Hebrews 9:28)
HOLY SPIRIT
 – GOD IS PRESENT
When Jesus ascended to Heaven after being resurrected from the dead, He sent the Holy Spirit to empower believers to live a victorious life over sin. The Holy Spirit baptizes the believer internally and gives spiritual gifts that strengthen and encourage the church.  
(Romans 12:6-8; Ephesians 4:8-12)
MANKIND
 – CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD
God designed man and woman in His own image. When the first man and woman disobeyed God, they introduced sin resulting in the fall of mankind from the relationship with God and the status of authority that God intended for them and their descendants to walk in.  
(Romans 5:12,18, Romans 3:10,23; 6:23; 14:23;
James 4:17; 1 John 5:17)
SALVATION
 – GOD’S ONLY PLAN
Salvation is a free gift which cannot be earned but received only by faith and the repentance of sins. We are restored to relationship with God and the status of authority we were designed for by God’s grace.  
(Romans 5:11; Ephesians 2:8-9; Hebrews 9:12,22)
BAPTISM
 – A NEW IDENTITY
God instructs believers to be identified with Christ through water baptism. It is a symbolic and spiritual act signifying death to sin and being resurrected with a new identity in Christ.  
(Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38,39; 19:1-6)
ETERNITY
 – FOREVER AND EVER
Man was created to exist forever. Salvation gives us access to eternity in Heaven with God. While the rejection of God and His gift of salvation result in an eternity separated from Him.  
(John 3:16; 5:24, Mark 9:43-48; II Thessalonians 1:9; Revelation 20:10-15)
