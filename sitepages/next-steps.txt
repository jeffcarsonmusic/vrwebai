NEXT STEPS
 is a series of 4 steps designed to introduce you to the mission of Dreamer's Church, answer your questions, and allow us to get to know you better.
The first two steps in our Next Steps takes place every Sunday right after both services.
 The class starts 10 minutes after church and goes for about 45 minutes, food and childcare are provided.
We will share about our church story, structure, and ministry philosophy, and take you on a journey of discovering how you have been uniquely created by God.
